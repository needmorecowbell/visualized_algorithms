# Grid Cube Expand from Center

Creates an invisible 3d grid of cubes. Starting at the center of the cube (using odd numbered rows&columns), make each cube visible by crawling outward. 

See [grid_cube_expansion](https://github.com/needmorecowbell/visualized_algorithms/tree/main/grid_cube_expansion) for an example where the target isn't always the center.
